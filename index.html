      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/logankeyes.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="placeholder">

      <p>Full Stack Web Developer with experience as a manager and sales professional for eight years I have always been passionate about being a team leader, exceeding goals each month, and building client relations. I have always adopted new concepts to help better my clients, my company, and myself. </p>

      <p>During my time, I have worked with some of the best management anyone could ask for. Starting in 2010 at Buerkle as a part-time night janitor, within 2 months I was working full time on the floor helping out clients and selling services. After a few years of exceeding my service sales and client retention quotas, I was promoted to service manager at Buerkle Acura.</p>

      <p>After many years at Buerkle and testing myself as a general manager at Donnybrooke Motorsports, I have decided to change fields into something I have always been interested in. I am currently attending a software development course at the University of Minnesota. I am hopeful to make a career out of something I enjoy to do. </p>
